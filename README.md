# AI-Powered Clothing Store

This project is a demonstration of an e-commerce website that leverages AI for content generation and customer interaction.

## Ethics and Quality Assurance

The use of AI in this project is governed by a commitment to transparency, fairness, and quality.

### 1. Hallucination and Bias Mitigation

*   **Human-in-the-Loop:** All AI-generated content (product descriptions, headlines, etc.) is treated as a first draft. A human editor must review, fact-check, and approve all content before it is published to the live site. Product details are cross-referenced with an internal master database to ensure accuracy.
*   **Diverse Representation:** AI prompts for image generation are explicitly engineered to request diversity in ethnicity, age, and body type. We actively monitor outputs to ensure fair and inclusive representation and avoid stereotypes.

### 2. Transparency

*   **AI-Assisted Content:** We will clearly state that AI is used to assist in creating content and providing customer support.
*   **User Reviews:** AI-generated user testimonials are used for demonstration purposes to simulate a populated site. In a live environment, they would be clearly labeled as "Example Reviews" or replaced entirely with genuine customer feedback. The chatbot will always identify itself as an AI assistant.

### 3. Fact-Checking and Validation

All factual claims generated by AI, such as material composition, care instructions, or sustainability metrics, are validated against a "source of truth" database maintained by the product and sourcing teams. The AI models are not used to generate factual information but rather to craft descriptive text based on verified facts provided to them.
